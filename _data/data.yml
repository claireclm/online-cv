career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Developer/technical lead in a large fortune 100 company, a mid-size company
      and a small start-up. In this timeframe, I designed large systems as well as
      working directly with customers on site, for example VISA.
      Started in Liberty IT in 2002 progressing very successfully through the 
      technical roles into a senior technical position. After 10 years of being 
      a technical lead on a number of large projects, I made the decision to continue
      my career down a leadership path. 
      
      I saw huge potential for me to influence, coach and drive positive change in our 
      leadership of projects, products and teams. I have pushed through improvements such 
      as the adoption of Key Performance Indicator KPI) Driven Development and 
      Behaviour Driven Development(BDD) on my teams. In each of my teams I have 
      championed and coached the adoption of core agile delivery lifecycles/practices such 
      as Scrum, Kanban, exploratory testing and continuous delivery. 
      Championing XP practices on my teams. I use techniques like impact mapping to ensure 
      teams are delivering maximum impact to customers and Event Storming to help teams 
      improve business processes, remove blockers and break systems down into domains.
      
      I am currently leading a portfolio of teams developing Cloud Architectures, AWS, 
      Docker, Kafka and Spring Cloud, my teams are modernizing complex monolith 
      applications into event driven micro service architectures.
      Fully support a learning culture on teams, promoting innovation sprints, 
      training sprints (entire team training together). Teams working to get AWS 
      certifications together. I have learned to adapt my leadership styles based on 
      the portfolio of teams experience, capabilities and the context we are operating in.
      
      I have experience of all aspects of large scale portfolio management, costs,
      forecasting and risk management.
